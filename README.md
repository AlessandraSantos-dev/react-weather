### About the Project
During the Workshop, the tutor goes through the process of creating a Weather App, step by step, but the design they focused on was very different from the design that I created. Moving away from the course's design made me come accorss challenges that I had to figure out by myself.

### Built With
- React
- HTML
- CSS

- Bootstrap
